# SublimeProfiles
## Profile manager plugin for sublime.
The missing Profile Manager from sublime is finally here!

## Google Drive support
[![google drive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrian-tut/SublimeProfiles/master/icons/drive.png)](https://www.google.com/drive/)

It stores your data on your own Google Drive account, making easy to recreate your very own environment anywhere you go.

## Profile syncronization support for:
	☑ user settings
	☑ key bindings
	☑ installed packages
	☑ disabled packages
	☑ locally installed packages (which were not installed via package control)

All of these items above are stored per profile, meaning you can switch between multiple configurations whenever you want.

## Multi-profile support:
	☑ Create profiles
	☑ Delete profiles
	☑ Switch between profile

Creating a new profile will fork the current active configuration, and actived the newly created profile.
Any changes you make from that point on will only be synchronized on the newly created profile until you switch.

You can switch between multiple configurations whenever you want.
